Module 4 - Time Series Modelling

The Main Goal of this project is to provide analysis and predictions for investing in U.S real estate given the investor's risk and investment profile.

The Data Analysed is provided by Zillow and represents U.S monthly sales data by region, state and zipcode for the periods 1996-04 - 2018-04.

The Target is to predict for the real estate investor the top 5 postcodes to invest in from 2018-04
The Pre-requisites being the real estate investor would like to focus on investing in the city of Chicago. The subset of zipcodes to invest in are those zipcodes that
1] Did not decrease in value by more than the average mean ROI for Chicago zipcodes during the U.S property market crash environ January 2009.
2] Further had the highest ROI in the period following the crash.
3] The real estate investor, according to their risk profile, believe that this would help reduce the risk that any steep increase in property price following the crash did not reflect a steep decrease during the crash period.
